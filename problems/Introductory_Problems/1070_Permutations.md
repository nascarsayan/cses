  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A permutation of integers $1,2,\ldots,n$ is called _beautiful_ if there are no
adjacent elements whose difference is $1$.

Given $n$, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

# Input

The only input line contains an integer $n$.

# Output

Print a beautiful permutation of integers $1,2,\ldots,n$. If there are several
solutions, you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, print "NO
SOLUTION".

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^6$

# Example 1

Input:

    
    
    5
    

Output:

    
    
    4 2 5 3 1
    

# Example 2

Input:

    
    
    3
    

Output:

    
    
    NO SOLUTION
