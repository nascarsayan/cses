CSES - Necessary Roads

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ cities and $m$ roads between them. There is a route between any
two cities.

A road is called _necessary_ if there is no route between some two cities
after removing that road. Your task is to find all necessary roads.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of cities and
roads. The cities are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are $m$ lines that describe the roads. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is a road between cities $a$ and $b$. There is at
most one road between two cities, and every road connects two distinct cities.

# Output

First print an integer $k$: the number of necessary roads. After that, print
$k$ lines that describe the roads. You may print the roads in any order.

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

    
    
    5 5
    1 2
    1 4
    2 4
    3 5
    4 5
    

Output:

    
    
    2
    3 5
    4 5
