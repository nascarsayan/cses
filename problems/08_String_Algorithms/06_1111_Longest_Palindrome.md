CSES - Longest Palindrome

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given a string, your task is to determine the longest palindromic substring of
the string. For example, the longest palindrome in `aybabtu` is `bab`.

# Input

The only input line contains a string of length $n$. Each character is one of
aâ€“z.

# Output

Print the longest palindrome in the string. If there are several solutions,
you may print any of them.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

    
    
    aybabtu
    

Output:
