CSES - Substring Order II

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a string of length $n$. If all of its substrings (not
necessarily distinct) are ordered lexicographically, what is the $k$th
smallest of them?

# Input

The first input line has a string of length $n$ that consists of characters
a–z.

The second input line has an integer $k$.

# Output

Print the $k$th smallest substring in lexicographical order.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le k \le \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

# Example

Input:

    
    
    baabaa
    10
    

Output:

    
    
    ab
    

Explanation: The 10 smallest substrings in order are a, a, a, a, aa, aa, aab,
aaba, aabaa, and ab.
