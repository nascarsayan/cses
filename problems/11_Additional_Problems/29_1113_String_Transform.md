CSES - String Transform

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Consider the following string transformation:

  1. append the character # to the string (we assume that # is lexicographically smaller than all other characters of the string)
  2. generate all rotations of the string
  3. sort the rotations in increasing order
  4. based on this order, construct a new string that contains the last character of each rotation

For example, the string `babc` becomes `babc#`. Then, the sorted list of
rotations is `#babc`, `abc#b`, `babc#`, `bc#ba`, and `c#bab`. This yields a
string `cb#ab`.

# Input

The only input line contains the transformed string of length $n+1$. Each
character of the original string is one of aâ€“z.

# Output

Print the original string of length $n$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

    
    
    cb#ab
    

Output:

    
    
    babc
