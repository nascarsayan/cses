# Number Spiral

## TL;DR
This problem involves finding the value at a specific position in an infinite number spiral grid. The solution uses mathematical patterns to determine the value efficiently.

## Problem Summary
[Problem Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1071)

A number spiral is an infinite grid whose upper-left square has number 1. Your task is to find out the number in row y and column x.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is straightforward:

1. Identify the maximum of the row and column values.
2. Calculate the base value for the maximum value's layer in the spiral.
3. Adjust the base value based on the parity (odd/even) of the maximum value and the relative positions of the row and column.
4. Print the calculated value for each test case.

## Solution Analysis

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
  r, c = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
  mx = max(r, c)
  val = (mx - 1) * (mx - 1)
  if mx % 2 == 1:
    r, c = c, r
  val += r
  if c < r:
    val += (r - c)
  print(val)
```

The solution works as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the row and column values.
3. Identify the maximum of the row and column values.
4. Calculate the base value for the maximum value's layer in the spiral.
5. Adjust the base value based on the parity (odd/even) of the maximum value and the relative positions of the row and column.
6. Print the calculated value for each test case.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for each test case, as we perform a constant number of operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a few integer variables for counting.

## Key Insights
1. This problem teaches us to handle infinite grids and use mathematical patterns to determine values efficiently.
2. It emphasizes the importance of edge cases, such as the parity of the maximum value.
3. The problem is a good exercise in mathematical reasoning and pattern recognition.

## Common Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to handle the parity of the maximum value correctly.
2. Not handling the case where the row and column values are equal.
3. Incorrectly calculating the base value for the maximum value's layer.

## Extensions
1. What if we need to find the value at multiple positions in the grid? The approach would be similar, but we need to handle multiple test cases.
2. What if the grid has a different starting value? The solution would still work, but we need to adjust the base value calculation accordingly.
3. What if we need to find the value at a specific position in a different type of grid? The approach would depend on the grid's pattern and structure.
