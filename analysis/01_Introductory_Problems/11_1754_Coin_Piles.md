# Coin Piles

## TL;DR
This problem involves determining if two coin piles can be emptied by repeatedly removing one coin from one pile and two coins from the other, or vice versa. The solution uses mathematical properties to determine if the piles can be emptied.

## Problem Summary
[Problem Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1754)

You have two coin piles containing a and b coins. On each move, you can either remove one coin from the left pile and two coins from the right pile, or two coins from the left pile and one coin from the right pile. Your task is to efficiently find out if you can empty both the piles.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is straightforward:

1. For each test case, read the values of a and b.
2. Ensure that a is the smaller value and b is the larger value.
3. Calculate the value 2 * a - b.
4. If the value is non-negative and divisible by 3, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

## Solution Analysis
[Solution Link](/solutions/01_Introductory_Problems/11_1754_Coin_Piles.py)

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
  m, M = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
  m, M = min(m, M), max(m, M)
  val = 2 * m - M
  if val >= 0 and val % 3 == 0:
    print("YES")
  else:
    print("NO")
```

The solution works as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the values of a and b.
3. Ensure that a is the smaller value and b is the larger value.
4. Calculate the value 2 * a - b.
5. If the value is non-negative and divisible by 3, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for each test case, as we perform a constant number of operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a few integer variables for counting.

## Key Insights
1. This problem teaches us to handle mathematical properties and use them to determine feasibility efficiently.
2. It emphasizes the importance of edge cases, such as a and b being very large or very small.
3. The problem is a good exercise in mathematical reasoning and problem-solving techniques.

## Common Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to handle the case where a and b are very small.
2. Incorrectly implementing the mathematical conditions for feasibility.
3. Not handling the input parsing correctly.

## Extensions
1. What if we need to determine the number of moves required to empty the piles? The approach would depend on the specific problem constraints.
2. What if the piles have different initial values? The solution would still work, but we need to adjust the conditions accordingly.
3. What if we need to find the number of ways to empty the piles? The approach would depend on the specific problem constraints.
