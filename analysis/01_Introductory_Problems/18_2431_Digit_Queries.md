# Digit Queries

## TL;DR
This problem involves finding the digit at a specific position in an infinite string of concatenated positive integers. The solution uses mathematical properties to determine the digit efficiently.

## Problem Summary

Consider an infinite string that consists of all positive integers in increasing order: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425... Your task is to process q queries of the form: what is the digit at position k in the string?

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is straightforward:

1. Precompute the lengths of chunks of digits for different ranges of numbers.
2. For each query, determine the range in which the position k falls.
3. Calculate the exact number and digit position within that number.
4. Print the corresponding digit.

## Solution Analysis

```python
import bisect
chunks = [0]
qList = []
qLen = int(input())
for _ in range(qLen):
  qList.append(int(input()))
lim = max(qList)
while chunks[-1] < lim:
  digs = len(chunks)
  chunks.append((9 * (10**(digs-1))) * digs + chunks[-1])
for q in qList:
  digs = bisect.bisect_left(chunks, q)
  offset = chunks[digs-1]
  chunkDigPos = q - offset - 1
  numPos = chunkDigPos // digs
  start = 10**(digs-1)
  number = start + numPos
  numDigPos = (digs-1) - (chunkDigPos%digs)
  digit = (number // (10**numDigPos)) % 10
  print(digit)
```

The solution works as follows:
1. Precompute the lengths of chunks of digits for different ranges of numbers.
2. For each query, determine the range in which the position k falls using binary search.
3. Calculate the exact number and digit position within that number.
4. Print the corresponding digit.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log k) for each query, as we use binary search to determine the range and calculate the digit position.
- **Space Complexity**: O(log k) for storing the precomputed lengths of chunks.

## Key Insights
1. This problem teaches us to handle large sequences and use mathematical properties to determine positions efficiently.
2. It emphasizes the importance of understanding binary search and its applications.
3. The problem is a good exercise in sequence manipulation and problem-solving techniques.

## Common Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to handle the case where k is very large.
2. Incorrectly implementing the binary search logic.
3. Not handling the input parsing correctly.

## Extensions
1. What if we need to find the digit at a specific position in a different type of sequence? The approach would depend on the specific sequence and its properties.
2. What if the sequence contains special characters? The solution would still work, but we need to adjust the calculations accordingly.
3. What if we need to find the number of digits in a specific range? The approach would depend on the specific problem constraints.
