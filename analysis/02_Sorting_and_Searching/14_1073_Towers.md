# Towers

[Problem Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1073) | [Solution Link](../../solutions/02_Sorting_and_Searching/14_1073_Towers.cpp)

## TL;DR
Use ordered map to track tower tops and their frequencies. For each cube, place it below the smallest larger cube (or start new tower).

## Problem Overview
Given n cubes with different sizes, build minimum number of towers where each cube can only be placed on a larger cube. Cubes must be processed in given order.

## Solution Approach
This problem uses a greedy approach with efficient tower top tracking:

1. **Tower Management**
   - Map stores (size, frequency) of tower tops
   - For each new cube, find smallest tower top > cube
   - Replace that top with new cube (or start new tower)

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Use lower_bound(cube + 1) to find next larger top
   - Decrease frequency of tower being modified
   - Remove tower top if frequency becomes 0
   - Add new cube as tower top

## Key Learning Points
1. **Greedy Choice Property**
   - Always optimal to use smallest possible larger cube
   - No need to track full towers, only tops matter
   - Order of processing enforced by problem

2. **Data Structure Choice**
   - Map provides O(log n) operations
   - Handles multiple towers of same height
   - Efficient for finding next larger value

## Common Pitfalls
1. Not handling multiple towers of same height
2. Forgetting to remove towers with zero frequency
3. Wrong comparison in lower_bound
4. Not considering case when no larger tower exists

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

  2. LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence)
  3. Box stacking variations
  4. Online algorithms with ordering constraints

## Tips for Similar Problems
1. Consider what minimal information needs tracking
2. Look for greedy properties
3. Think about efficient ways to find next/previous elements
4. Handle duplicates carefully

## Real-world Applications
- Container stacking in ports
- Resource allocation with constraints
- Process scheduling
- Memory management

## Why Greedy Works
1. Using smallest possible larger cube preserves options
2. No benefit in using larger cube than necessary
3. Order constraint removes need for backtracking
4. Local optimal choice leads to global optimal
